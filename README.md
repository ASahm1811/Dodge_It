# Dodge It
"Dodge It" is a game which I programmed in Java during my spare time. The main goal is exactly as what the game is called (Dodge It), to be more precise: control your player to dodge the incoming enemies as long as possible. In my opinion, if you managed to get a higher score than "15000", then you deserve to be named "Pro gamer". So, feel free to clone this repository and don't forget: have fun!!! :)
